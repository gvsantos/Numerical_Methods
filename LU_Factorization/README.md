# LU Factorization 

This algorithm is designed to determine the LU Factorization for a given square matrix, while also employing partial pivoting.

### Inputs:

* A - square coefficient matrix 

### Outputs:

* L - lower triangular matrix 
* U - upper triangular matrix 
* P - pivot matrix 

This algorithm also includes error checks for: if the given matrix is square and if there are an appropriate number of input values.
